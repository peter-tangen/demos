		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF">► Hello!</h2>
		
        <p style="color:#FFFFFF">
		My name is Peter, and I'm a 3D environment artist and graphics programmer.<br />
		I have been around 3D graphics in a creative capacity since about 2007, and have through the 2010s fallen <br />
		in love with computer programming relating to realtime, interactive 3D, between multiple technologies. <br /><br />
		I'm currently working on a quite in-depth 3D video game project, all running on self-written software.<br />
		Most of the work at the moment is "boring" engine stuff, which doesn't really lend itself to a visual showcase,<br />
		but when it makes sense to do so, I'll upload some demos showcasing the work here.<br />
		</p>
		
		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF">► About CAR Engine</h2>
		
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF">
		The renderer responsible for delivering the visual aspects of my current project is called "CAR Engine".<br />
		It's a Canvas-Agnostic Rasterizer written in C(99) that, like with the rest of the game tech, runs entirely <br />
		in software on the CPU. The main goal of this is portability with consistent visuals that aren't dependent<br />
		on the user's specific graphics hardware, drivers and settings. Another goal is to not waste storage space <br />
		and network, as it is all quite small! Also, enjoy near-instant loading times on modern computers!
		</p>
